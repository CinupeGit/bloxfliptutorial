    <h1>How do I play games to gamble?</h1>

    <p>To play games to gamble on, click on the "menu" button on mobile. But for PC, go to the left of your screen and navigate games there! (They are on the homepage too.) </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Nice, but how do I actually gamble?</h1>

    <p>Great question. once you've found the game you want to gamble on, set a bet that you want to gamble. Then, click "start new game"!</p>
    <p>Please use a budget, perform calculations to make sure that you aren't using too much Robux that'll make you go broke..</p>

    <h1>What are the best games to play?</h1>

    <p>The games that I usually play are cases battle, dice, towers and mines. They are fun games, but I dont recommend playing games like cups because they are RNG and there is no strategy to win, it's just pure luck.</p>
