    <h1>What is a rain?</h1>

    <p>A rain is started by a user that gives out free Robux, basically taking the amount of Robux the user had put into the rain, and dividing it between everyone so you can still get Robux, but not much when multiple people join.</p>
    <p>Rains are VERY common. They start all the time! People usually put alot of Robux into them, meaning you can get more Robux!</p>

    <h1>How do I make an account/add an account?</h1>

    <p>First, navagate to <a href="https://Bloxflip.com">Bloxflip.com</a> and log in, or create a new account on <a href="https://roblox.com">Roblox.com</a> if you don't trust one of your main accounts being logged into by a third party website.</p>
    <p>Then, log in on   <a href="https://Bloxflip.com">Bloxflip.com</a> so you can start winning Robux!</p>

    <h1>How to join rains (For free)</h1>

    <p>To join rains for free, navagate to the "Chat" on mobile, or go to the right of your screen on PC. Whenever a rain starts, next to the chat box, there will be a "Join for Free" button. Click it whenever a rain starts.</p>
    <p>You will have to solve a captcha to prove you are not a robot so bots cannot farm the website for free Robux.</p>

    <h1>How do I know when a rain starts?</h1>

    <p>Though Bloxflip may not notify you when a rain starts, you can join discord servers that ping you whenever a rain has started on Bloxflip!</p>
    <p>Here's the one that I use.</p>

    <h1>How does Bloxflip work?</h1>
    <h3>Great question!</h3>
    <p>Bloxflip works by logging into your account so they can use bots to buy gamepasses so you can deposit, or use bots to buy your gamepasses to withdraw.</p>
